# Unifier Installer
A Discord bot to make installing Unifier easier. Not my most well-written code, but it
gets the job done.

## Setup
Download the repository, then run installer.py on the machine and directory you want to
install Unifier on.

You will need your Discord user ID and your bot's token for this.
